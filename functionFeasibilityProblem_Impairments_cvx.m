function [feasible,Wsolution] = functionFeasibilityProblem_Impairments_cvx(H,D,Qsqrt,q,gammavar,EVMs)
%Solves the feasibility problem with quality-of-service (QoS) constraints
%and transceiver impairments in (4.46). The implementation is based on the
%convex formulation in Corollary 4.3, but has been simplified to only
%handle linear distortion functions.

%For numerical reasons, the implementation considers power minimization
%under the QoS requirements:
%
%minimize   betavar
%subject to SINR_k >= gammavar(k) for all users k,
%           Impairment constraints for all antennas,
%           Power constraints scaled by betavar.
%
%If this optimization problem is feasible and betavar<=1, then the 
%feasibility problem with QoS constraints is also feasible.
%
%This optimization problem is convex. The computational complexity is
%therefore polynomial in the number of users, antennas, and power
%constraints. The implementation can, at least, handle 30 users, 50
%antennas, and 50 power constraints.
%
%This is version 1.0.
%The implementation utilizes and requires CVX: http://cvxr.com/
%
%INPUT:
%H          = Kr x Kt*Nt matrix with row index for receiver and column
%             index transmit antennas
%D          = Kt*Nt x Kt*Nt x Kr diagonal matrix. Element (j,j,k) is one if
%             j:th transmit antenna can transmit to user k and zero otherwise
%Qsqrt      = N x N x L matrix with matrix-square roots of the L weighting 
%             matrices for the L power constraints
%q          = Limits of the L power constraints
%gammavar   = Kr x 1 vector with SINR constraints for all users.
%EVMs       = 2 x 1 vector with EVM at the transmit and receive antennas,
%             respectively. These are used along with linear distortion
%             functions.
%
%OUTPUT:
%feasible  = This variable is feasible=true if the feasibility problem is
%            feasible. Otherwise we have feasible=false.
%Wsolution = Kt*Nt x Kr matrix with beamforming achieved by the power
%            minimization problem. This matrix is empty if this problem is
%            infeasible.
